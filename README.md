As part of the course project for one of my university courses, I was part of a team of students
who were provided with data sets which had to be cleaned, engineered, visualized, and used in creating
classification models meant to predict which passengers would survive the sinking of the RMS Titanic
based on the features included in the data: age, sex, ticket class, fare paid, cabin location, et cetera).

We agreed to each complete the entire assignment independently, convening only after we were all done
to jointly decide which aspects of each member's implementation should be included in a unified final
version. Ultimately, it was decided that my cleaned and engineered data sets would be used, as well as
some of my visualizations and all of my models.

The implementation found in the ipynb file and the associated pdf include my original implementation, plus
any additional features I decided to add on after the team's decision was made. None of the code
found in these files are ripped from any of my teammates as such an act would be subversive to the team's
belief in independent work and accepting credit only for one's own work.

At the end of the project, we presented our work to the professor, and shortly afterwards we were
each given full credit for the assignment.
